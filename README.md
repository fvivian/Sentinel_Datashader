The notebook called SentinelWMS_Datashader utilises the datashading procedure presented by James A. Bednar (https://anaconda.org/jbednar/landsat/notebook) on Sentinel-2 MSI data from web map services (WMS) provided by Sinergise (http://www.sinergise.com/en).

Sentinel2_Datashader does basically the same thing as the first notebook but with a Sentinel-2 MSI product stored locally on the users machine.
